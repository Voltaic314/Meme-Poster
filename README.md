# Meme-Poster
This project was created by Logan Maupin. I am a student at the University of Arizona Online. I'm majoring in Applied Computing - Applied Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to one day contribute work towards machine learning models to help the world in some way (like AI that can detect cancer accurately for example). For now, here's a silly project I made. It's not the best, could be a lot better and a lot more optomized but I'm not that good of a programmer, I really just started programming a few months ago so my code is kinda meh. If you know of any ways to improve the code feel free to propose suggestions or tips to me, thank you!

About this code: This bot looks at a list of subreddits, picks 4 posts which contain images, also that aren't flagged as NSFW or spoilers, then saves those to a txt file, then the FB poster script posts from that text file given the image urls. 

Please note: This script requires API access to reddit that you must provide through your own reddit app, the key is not supplied in this code. FB is also the same way, for the FB Poster side of this code you will also need a token for a FB page as well. 

Also note: You will need a Reddit-Grabber-Log.txt and also FBPoster-Log.txt file to make this code work as well, best to store those in the same directory as the python scripts but you can path to them elsewhere if you need.
