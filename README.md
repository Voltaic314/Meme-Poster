# Meme-Poster
This project was created by Logan Maupin. I am a student at the University of Arizona Online. I'm majoring in Applied Computing - Applied Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to one day contribute work towards machine learning models to help the world in some way (like AI that can detect cancer accurately for example). For now, here's a silly project I made. It's not the best, could be a lot better and a lot more optomized but I'm not that good of a programmer, I really just started programming a few months ago so my code is kinda meh. If you know of any ways to improve the code feel free to propose suggestions or tips to me, thank you!

About this code: This bot looks at a list of subreddits, picks a post which contain images, also that aren't flagged as NSFW or spoilers, then posts the meme directly to FB, then logs that data to a spreadsheet so we don't post it again. It is scheduled in crontab on a Raspberry Pi so it will post every hour at the 00 minute mark.
