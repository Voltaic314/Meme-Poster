The files in this folder are the original versions (and their commit histories) of the original 2 scripts I made for this project.

I didn't actually change any parameters of how the codes work in the new editions, mainly just changed some variables and added a lot more functions and objects to work with. 

So primarily this code just serves as a proverbial "what-not-to-do" type of code that you should not follow. It will work but it is bad dumb code that should not be taken seriously. 

I don't mean to be so hard on myself. After all, I wrote these 2 scripts with some extreme determination with never taking a formal class in Python. 

I scraped these codes together with no formal training in python, only been coding for about 6 months up until I made them. So I will always be proud of them, 
no matter how bad they were. I've come a long way from print hello world to here. I'm very happy with my progress I've made in Python up until this point and can't wait
to see where my journey takes me next. 

I don't have any more major plans for my current scripts, as I've primarily implemented all the things I want to implement. I think now I will work on just researching
more refactoring technniques. Might even take a break to learn JavaScript at some point since my part time job is for a web software company. That would be kind of cool. 

Anyways, just want to say thanks to everybody who supported me along the way. Thanks to all who helped me succeed. 

Also, want to give a HUGE shoutout to Reddit User F3Zinker, who refactored a lot of my RG script. Without his help, I would have never had a reference point to pivot off
of. With his help in refactoring my code I was able to see what he was doing and why he was doing it. I very quickly picked up on when and were to make functions and why 
they are used in Python. 

It's like private tutoring in a way. So, friend, wherever you are out there in the world, you have all the thanks I could ever give.

Thank you.
